### About Myself:
I'm open to gaining experience and ready to study the information related to my profile for a better
understanding of it. Studying at the university, I take a responsible attitude to work, I'm used to withstanding
heavy mental loads. I'm sociable, I can find a common language with the team, I'm glad to communicate with
like-minded people, and I'm also ready to share my existing knowledge. I really like to learn something new in the
sphere of Web application development. I'm interested in becoming a Full-Stack developer. In the 1st year, he
successfully learned basic programming, charting and algorithms, acquired an understanding of OOP. I can work
with GitHub, Jira, Trello. At the moment I'm one of the developers of the online store project. The project uses
the TypeScript programming language and the NestJS framework. To view this work of mine and the others,
