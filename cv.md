### Code example:
**Task from CODEWARS:** _a Narcissistic Number_ is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits,
each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves
to decimal (base 10). Return true or false depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10.

```
function narcissistic(value) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < value.toString().length; i++) {
        sum += Math.pow(+value.toString()[i], value.toString().length);
    }
  
    return sum === value;
}
```
